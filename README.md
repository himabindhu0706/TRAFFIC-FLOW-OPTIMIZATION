--# TRAFFIC-FLOW-OPTIMIZATION-NM

🚦 Traffic Flow Optimization


📌 Introduction

Urban traffic congestion is a growing challenge, leading to wasted time, increased emissions, and commuter frustration. This project aims to optimize traffic flow by using real-time and historical data to analyze patterns, predict congestion, and provide actionable recommendations. The goal is to create smarter cities with efficient transportation systems.


🎯 Objectives

Analyze real-time and historical traffic data to detect congestion points.

Predict future traffic patterns using machine learning algorithms.

Visualize traffic flow to support traffic management and planning.

Optimize traffic signal timings and suggest alternate routes.

Enable authorities and commuters to make data-informed decisions.


📊 Data Sources

Public Datasets:

Google Traffic Data APIs

OpenStreetMap (OSM)

[City/State Open Data Portals] (e.g., NYC Open Data)

[Traffic Sensor Data] from city traffic departments

Simulated Data (if real-time data is not available)


📈 Visualization

Interactive heatmaps of traffic density

Time-series plots showing congestion trends

Animated maps for route comparisons

Dashboards using tools like:

Plotly / Dash

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Leaflet.js / Folium for geo-based visualization


🛠 Technologies Used

Languages: Python, JavaScript

Frameworks & Libraries:

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn (for data analysis & ML)

Flask / FastAPI (for backend APIs)

Dash / Streamlit (for dashboards)

Folium / Leaflet.js (for maps)

Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB

Other Tools: Git, Docker (optional)
